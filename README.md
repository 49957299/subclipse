# Subclipse
Subclipse - Eclipse SVN Provider

# History
This repository was cloned from its original home at http://subclipse.tigris.org
The original SVN repository housed three projects (Subclipse, svnClientAdapter and svnAnt)
Best attempt possible was made to prune out the history though branches and tags did not
make it and features like svn:externals do not translate to Git.

# License
The source code for this project is licensed under Eclipse 1.0 license.
