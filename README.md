# Subclipse  [![Build Status](https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/workflows/Subclipse%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/actions)

Subclipse is an Eclipse Team Provider plugin for Apache Subversion. 

Information on Requirements, Installation, Development etc. is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/wiki)

**NOTE:** Unfortunately this project is only minimally maintained and is reliant solely on contributions from others via PR. We can help make new releases if enough interesting contributions show up but there is otherwise no one who actively works on this code any longer.

We recommend installing the [snpashot release](https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/wiki#snapshot-builds) so that when there are contributions that are merged you receive them and are not dependent on a new official release being published.

Also, this project has never maintained or been involved with SVNKit. We host an update site out of convenience because that project has never published a working update site for the Eclipse P2 installer. We would otherwise recommend downloading and installing the latest release of their library from https://svnkit.com. The offline archive of their Eclipse plugin should install and work correctly.
